Like the first one, only better, but less adaptable to other games because it is more specifically designed for my games!

An HTML page with javascript random dice and list-pickers.

Simply download the file to your computer.

Open the file by double-clicking the file name from your file explorer.

It will run as a local web page in your browser.

Use it when playing my play-by-post zombie adventure games on steemit or hive. Games can be found in @happyme's blogs.

Enjoy
